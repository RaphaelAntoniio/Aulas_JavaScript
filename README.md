# Files I used for JavaScript study

In this repository you will find files from<br/>
ğŸ‘‰ our dear 'Hello world'<br/>
ğŸ‘‰ through functions<br/>
ğŸ‘‰ classes<br/>
ğŸ‘‰ objects<br/>
ğŸ‘‰ programming logic<br/>
ğŸ‘‰ oriented programming<br/>
among other things.
I hope it will be useful both for other people's studies and for getting to know a little more about me.
